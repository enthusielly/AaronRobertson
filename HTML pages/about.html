			<p>Aaron Robertson is a Composer, Songwriter and Producer based in Toronto, Canada.  Infused with an eclectic DIY spirit, and a compulsion to write songs, Aaron has been writing, recording, and releasing genre-hopping music since he was a teenager.</p>
 
			<p>While volunteering as the Production Manager at UBC's campus radio station, CITR, Aaron released several low fi home recorded college radio charting singles and EPs under various band names, getting comparisons to Beck and Daniel Johnston. After graduating from university, he studied Irish fiddle music before falling under the spell of avant-garde jazz greats John Zorn and Marc Ribot. He quickly found a mentor in jazz guitarist Karlheinz Kiehlmann with whom he studied guitar, composition, and harmony for many years.</p>
 
			<p>Aaron returned to recording in 2007, releasing two albums on UK label SVC Records under the alias Victor Scott. </p>

				<p class="quote">&ldquo;one of the year's best for sure.&rdquo;<br><class id="quoteby"> &mdash;Shake Your Fist</p>

			<p>In 2008, a fan created video for his song &ldquo;Gotta Go&rdquo; and won the Best Video of the Year award at the Canadian International Film Festival. After SVC folded, he released two more albums independently on his own Zygamatix label. </p>
 
			<p>After abandoning work on his fifth Victor Scott album due to tinnitus, Aaron moved to Toronto where he became involved in playing live in original and cover bands. He returned to recording music by writing the theme song for his favourite podcast, Cooking Issues. This led to other gigs and offers to score film and video game projects.  </p> 
 
			<p>Aaron spends most of his time in his studio surrounded by acoustic instruments, which he combines with modern recording and production techniques to create his unique tracks and soundscapes for sync, library, and custom scoring projects. He also does occasional session work and plays around Toronto in his post punk trio, the Tape Eagles.</p>
